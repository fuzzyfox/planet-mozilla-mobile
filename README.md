Planet Mozilla Mobile
=====================
Overview
--------
So Planet Mozilla Mobile came out of my brain when I finally decided enough was
enough and that Planet Mozilla needed to work well on my mobile phone (nexus one).

I set to work by deciding not to use too much of what already existed of the
current planet and work with the RSS feed. I did however make the choice to try
and keep a visual reference to the original so that if this is ever taken up by
the powers behind Planet Mozilla, it would be kept in theme.

Planet Mozilla Mobile is written in PHP, HTML 4 (HTML 5 coming soon), CSS, and a
little jQuery. It is also using the SimplePie PHP RSS Agregation class. This is
to change soon as not all of the class is needed and I want to make this project
as small as possible.
